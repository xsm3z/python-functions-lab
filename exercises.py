# Exercise 1: Calculate Area of a Triangle
#
# Write a function named `calculate_area_triangle` that takes the base and height of a triangle and returns the area.
# The area formula is (base * height) / 2.
#
# Examples:
# calculate_area_triangle(10, 5) should return 25.0.
# calculate_area_triangle(7, 3) should return 10.5.
#
# Define your function and call it below.

def calculate_area_triangle(base, height):
  area = (base * height) / 2
  return area

print('Exercise 1:', calculate_area_triangle(10, 5))


# Exercise 2: Calculate Simple Interest
#
# Write a function named `simple_interest` that takes principal, rate of interest (as a percentage), and time (years).
# Calculate and return the simple interest using the formula (principal * rate * time) / 100.
#
# Examples:
# simple_interest(1000, 5, 2) should return 100.
# simple_interest(1500, 3.5, 5) should return 262.5.
#
# Define your function and call it to see the result.

def simple_interest(principle, rate, time):
  interest = (principle * rate * time) / 100
  return interest

print('Exercise 2:', simple_interest(1000, 5, 2))


# Exercise 3: Apply a Discount
#
# Write a function named `apply_discount` that takes a product's price and a discount percentage (from 0 to 100).
# Return the new price after applying the discount.
#
# Examples:
# apply_discount(100, 25) should return 75.
# apply_discount(80, 10) should return 72.
#
# Define your function and call it to display the discounted price.

def apply_discount(price, discount_percentage):
    discount_amount = (price * discount_percentage) / 100
    new_price = price - discount_amount
    return new_price

print('Exercise 3:', apply_discount(100, 25))
